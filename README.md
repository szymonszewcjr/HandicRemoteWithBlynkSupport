# HandicRemoteWithBlynkSupport

Some arduino code to translate Sony remote codes to handic TV codes.

This acts as a translation layer between the sony remote I found in my drawer, and handic TV that I bought at local flea market for equivalence of 4 euros.
Codes were taken from [Lean Remote App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.leanremote.universalremotecontrol.remotecontrol&hl=en&gl=US) for Android.

Also controllable via blynk.
